# TODO

* ~~Start a TODO list~~

* ~~Update observation space to use `Box` (compatibility with OpenAI Gym).~~ (However sampling embedded categorical observation space is not supported yet)
* ~~Update action spaces to use `Discrete` class from `spaces` (compatibility with OpenAI Gym)~~
* ~~Add `use_target` flag to all environments (make hindsight experience replay possible)~~
* ~~Simplify redundant actions in cube turning env~~
* ~~Implement '1x1' (cube turning problem) version of cube puzzle~~ 
* Redefine the action space as a Discrete objects 
* Understand and get rid of the memory leak in DQN training
* ~~Implement Hindsight Experience Replay ([Andrychowicz <em>et al.</em> 2017](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7090-hindsight-experience-replay.html))~~
