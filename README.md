## Learning To Solve Rubik's Cube with Reinforcement Learning 

This is a reinforcement learning environment built around solving a Rubik's cube. 

The environment is a WIP, for the latest comments on progress see [progress.md](./progress.md) and for a non-exhaustive TODO list see [TODO.md](./TODO.md), which will probably be a bit more verbose than logged issues.
